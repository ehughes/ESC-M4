=============================

Example description
-------------------
This example shows how to select a clock output and divider to
route to the CLKOUT signal.

Special connection requirements
-------------------------------
Connect oscilloscope to J2-2 (P0-21).
Note that the output clock is divided by 10,
so the 12MHz FRO will appear as a 1.2MHz clock.
