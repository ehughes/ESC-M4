LPC5411x USB Virtual Comm port Example
======================================

Example description
-------------------
The example shows how to use USBD ROM stack to create a virtual comm port.
When the USB on J5 is connected to a PC, the host would recognize the USB connection as 
a new serial port. Using a serial terminal communication between the host and LPC5411x can be established.


Special connection requirements
-------------------------------
For USB to connect the jumper JP10 should be installed on the LPC5411x board.
For downloading code and debugging connect an USB cable to micro
connector (J7) and host.
Connect another USB cable between micro connector (J5) on board
and to a host.
