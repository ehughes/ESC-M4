Overview
========
The True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is a hardware accelerator module that generates a 512-bit
entropy as needed by an entropy consuming module or by other post processing functions. The TRNG
Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to generate random numbers
and prints them to the terminal.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.60.1
- Keil MDK 5.18a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2015-4.9-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- Atollic TrueSTUDIO 5.5.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- J-Link ARM
- TWR-KV58F220M board
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
Connect a serial cable from the debug UART port of the board to the PC. Start Tera Term
(http://ttssh2.osdn.jp) and make a connection to the virtual serial port.

1. Start Tera Term
2. New connection -> Serial
3. Set apropriate COMx port (x is port number) in Port context menu. Number is provided by operation
   system and could be different from computer to computer. Select COM number related to virtual
   serial port. Confirm selected port by OK button.
4. Set following connection parameters in menu Setup->Serial port...
        Baud rate:    115200
        Data:         8
        Parity:       none
        Stop:         1
        Flow control: one
5.  Confirm selected parameters by OK button.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
